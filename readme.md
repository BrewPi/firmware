[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BrewPi/firmware.svg?branch=feature%2Ftravis-ci)](https://travis-ci.org/BrewPi/firmware)

This is the main source code repository  for the firmware on the BrewPi brewing temperature controller.


## Getting started
End users will not have to compile the firmware themselves.

We provide pre-compiled binaries [in releases](https://github.com/BrewPi/firmware/releases).


## Updating your controller
Our update script (part of [brewpi-tools](https://github.com/elcojacobs/brewpi-tools)) automatically downloads the latest release to flash to your controller.

To update your controller, the brewpi script and the web interface, you will generally just run:
```
cd ~/brewpi-tools
sudo python updater.py
```

You can also upload to your controller from the BrewPi web interface. For the Spark Core, this requires that you already have a version of BrewPi running on it. If not, read how to flash via DFU below.


## Building the firmware for the Brewpi Spark
If you want to make your own changes to the firmware, follow these steps:

- in the firmwarwe repo, it is recommended to change to the "develop" branch: `git checkout develop`

Then browse to `platform/spark/` in the `firmware` repo and run make:

```
cd platform/spark
make
```

To build for the photon, use

```
cd platform/spark
make PLATFORM=photon
```


This will build the binary to the file `platform/spark/target/brewpi.bin`. You can upload your new binary via the BrewPi web interface.

## Flashing the firmware via DFU
If uploading firmware via the web interface fails, you can flash new firmware to your Spark Core with dfu-util. Please refer to this [guide on our community forum](https://community.brewpi.com/t/flashing-the-core-without-the-web-interface-fresh-core-or-in-case-of-emergency/).

You can also build the firmware and flash directly by running `make progra-dfu` from `platform/spark`.


## Building the firmware for Arduino
We do not recommend the Arduino to new users. The Spark platform is much more powerful and future proof. We will try to make new features available where possible for our existing Arduino users, but we are running into the limits of the platform.

To build our firmware for Arduino, you will have to use [Atmel Studio](http://www.atmel.com/microsite/atmel_studio6/). The repo includes an Atmel studio project. Select the right processor (Atmega328P for the Arduino Uno, Atmega32U4 for the Leonardo) and set up the right shield in Config.h.


## Changelog
A list of the changes per release can be found in the CHANGELOG file.
